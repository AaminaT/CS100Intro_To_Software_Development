# CS100Intro_To_Software_Development
### Through 7 labs and a final project, I learned how to use linux commands, make and run gtest suites, and developed insight into creating design patterns. By creating user stories, I understood how to break down clients needs.
### I learned more about github (pull requests, reviewing peers code) and developed good coding practices (differences in top-down and down-top designs).
